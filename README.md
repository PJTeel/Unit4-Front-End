<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

In this project I have created a full stack web application to showcase my miniature oil paintings. At this point, I am able to display five paintings on cards on the Home page. Clicking on a card will open a new Show page containing additional information on that painting. The Show page provides additional pictures, a description of the painting, and its size. I created my own backend database containing specific information and several pictures of each of the paintings. I used this database to seed my app. When I have additional paintings I want to include on the website I will modify my file and reseed the app.

I have also included an AboutMe page. This contains a little information about me. The page also provides a map of my location. It also contains a form for a person to send me an e-mail. At this time, the e-mailing function is not implemented. It is on my list of enhancements.

Currently, this app does a nice job of displaying my paintings. Long-term, I would like to add functuality that allows people to purchase paintings directly off the site. Until I get that functionality working I would like to provide a link to my etsy shop on this website. 

In addition, I would like to add a gallery page to display paintings that I have sold and/or completed to demonstrate my wide range of subjects. My long-term plan is to specialize in painting pet portraits. When I start doing this, I would like to have the ability to compare my final painting to the photo provided.

I would also like to include a section on either the Home or AboutMe page to list any upcoming art shows I will be participating in.

This app is deployed at: https://paula-unit4-front.herokuapp.com/

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/PJTeel/Unit4-Front-End) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

In terms of future enhancements, my top priority is to get the e-mail functionality working. Since I don't have any pricing information on my the site at this time, it is important people have a way to contact me. 

The current version of the app does a nice job of displaying my paintings. Long-term, I would like to add functuality that allows people to purchase paintings directly off the site. Until I get that functionality working I would like to include a link to my etsy shop on this website. 

In addition, I would like to add a gallery page to display paintings that I have sold and/or completed to demonstrate my wide range of subjects.

My long-term plan is to specialize in painting pet portraits. When I start doing this, I would like to have the ability to show examples of my final paintings to the photos provided.

Since I do take custom orders, it would be nice to have the ability for people to place orders and upload photos directly from the website.

I would also like to include a section on either the Home or AboutMe page to list any upcoming art shows I will be participating in.

If I receive positive feedback from customers I would like to include this information somewhere on the site.
